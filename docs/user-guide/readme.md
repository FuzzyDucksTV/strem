# User Guide Overview

In here we will attempt to cover the high lever aspects of the system and how to use them to create your own automation flows and portals as well as other parts of the system you may need to know about.

> These documents in here are only for end users and will not cover many topics related to developing for Strem, that is covered elsewhere.

## Main Strem Components

Strem is split into 4 main sections

- **Flows** - Defines automation `triggers` and `tasks`
- **Portals** - Creates optional front ends to drive flows
- **Todos** - Shows things that need manual actions from the user
- **Settings** - Allows you to configure Strem and setup integrations

We will cover each section separately but at a high level that is how the application is broken up.

You will probably fine `Flows` being the part of the system you spend most of your time setting up, as the other aspects of the system are optional for the most part, but its good to know they are there and what functionality they offer.
