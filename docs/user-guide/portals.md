# Portals

Portals allow you to setup user interfaces that can be used to drive your flows via button press triggers.

From here you can setup as many portals as you want each being configured with whatever functionality you would want to trigger from a browser or tablet/phone while you are streaming.

> You can also show todo lists in the portal so you have all the crucial information within one place to action.
