# What is Strem?

Strem is an automation application that primarily lets you automatically handle certain scenarios with automated `flows` rather than having to manually handle them yourself.

Some common use cases could be:
- Every X seconds send a follow reminder in chat
- Track deaths in games and display them on OBS
- Add custom commands on twitch
- Auto respond to certain chat strings
- Create clips automatically

You can do far more than those but you have to start somewhere.

## Main features

- Easy to use `Flow` system for handling automated tasks
- Growing integrations with various providers (i.e twitch, obs)
- Ability to make custom portals to drive flows from browser/devices
- Ability to raise todos to keep track of things you need to action

> There are a myriad of smaller features worth mentioning like the ability to write your own code in tasks in various languages as well as loads of out the box tasks for common things.

## How is this different to other tools like this?

It isn't that much different, it contains same sort of capabilities as the popular other tools in this area, the main difference is that this is open source and free to use.

Other tools in this area are often free to use but are not open source so if you find an issue or want to add functionality you need to jump through more hoops and constraints to get that work done.
