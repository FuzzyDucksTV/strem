# HELLO
Welcome to the Strem App docs
> If you are viewing this in github you can view the git book version of it [HERE](https://strem.gitbook.io/strem-app/)

The documentation here is both for end users who want to know how to use the application as well as for developers who want to add to the application or build plugins for it.

> Currently the application is in an Alpha state and may change between releases but for the most part it should not be DRASTICALLY different between versions for the time being.

Rather than put all the waffle in here the docs will be split up into sub sections so pick the area that pertains to what you want to know more about.

> If you have any questions feel free to raise them on the github issues page, once the community becomes big enough we can make a discord server for it.
